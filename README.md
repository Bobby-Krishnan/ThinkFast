**ThinkFast** is a fast-paced mental math game built with React and Firebase. Solve as many math problems as you can before the timer runs out. Play solo or challenge a friend in real-time multiplayer mode. This mental math trainer was heavily inspired by zetamac.com I have spent lots of time using zetamac in the past and wanted to make my own version of it that included certain features that I wished zetamac had as well.

**Live Demo:**
https://thinkfast-df319.web.app

**Features:**

Single Player Mode

Customizable number ranges

4 timer settings: 30-60-90-120 seconds

Skip feature: Press **Enter key** to skip a question with a -1 score penalty

**Multiplayer Mode**

Head-to-head real-time matches between two players

Create a lobby and share the code with your friend to join

Both players receive the exact same sequence of problems

At the moment, the only game mode possible for multiplayer is the deafult 120 second game with the default settings in the home page

**Global Stats**

Live "Problems Solved" counter on the home screen
