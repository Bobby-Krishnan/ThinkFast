**ThinkFast** is a fast-paced mental math game built with React and Firebase. Solve as many math problems as you can before the timer runs out. Play solo or challenge a friend in real-time multiplayer mode. This mental math trainer was heavily inspired by zetamac.com I have spent lots of time using zetamac in the past and wanted to make my own version of it that included certain features that I wished zetamac had as well.
